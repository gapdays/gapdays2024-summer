## Preparations before GAP Days

In preparation for these GAP Days please get your resources up to date.
Please note that this list will be updated on the go, as we find more things that need to be prepared.

- make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com) (they are free)
- make sure you can log in to [HackMD.io](https://hackmd.io), e.g. via your GitHub account
- get/check access to the [gap-system slack](https://gap-system.slack.com), in which there is a dedicated GAP Days channel.
  If you do not have access to this slack you can [email us](mailto:{{site.email}}) and we will invite you.
  All registered participants will be sent an invite link.

- You should have a recent version of GAP installed (4.12 or a development version built from the master branch)

<!-- 
- The workshop will take place on a <https://gather.town> workspace.
  All registered participants will be sent an invite link.
 -->

<!-- 
- if you are interested in OSCAR or the GAP-Julia integration, also install Julia (and OSCAR) beforehand; see <https://oscar.computeralgebra.de/install/> for hints how to do that (in fact this will also give you a GAP installation)
 -->
