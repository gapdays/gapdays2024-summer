### The effective use of the GRAPE package for computing with graphs and groups

The GRAPE package for GAP provides functionality for computing with
graphs together with associated groups of automorphisms, and is designed
primarily for applications in algebraic graph theory, permutation group
theory, design theory, and finite geometry. GRAPE has been developed and
been part of the GAP distribution for over thirty years now, and in this
talk I will present some of the philosophy of GRAPE and pointers on how
to make the most effective use of GRAPE in your research.
